            When looking at the number of accidents occuring each year, there is a clear drop around 2020, and it hasn't returned to normal levels by 2024. 
            <br><br>
            Noticing this difference in the crash trends pre and post Covid, you might wonder what trends you can see over different time periods, and how Covid affected trends over different time periods.

            Looking at the monthly crashes, if we plot how many crashes happen in daylight compared to those that happen at night, we notice an interesting pattern.
            <br><br>
            We notice that while daylight crashes are for the most part more common, the difference is more extreme in the summer compared to the winter.
            <br><br>
            This could be a combination of shorter days and daylight savings time shifting busier hours to be outside daylight hours.

            Now, if we look at the average number of crashes per year broken up by month, and compare pre and post Covid, we notice that the trends are similar.
            <br><br>
            While January to July have a bigger difference in shape, the overall trends are still mostly similar in shape, just with a reduced number of crashes post Covid

            When looking at the number of crashes occuring on each day of the week, the most crashes happen on Friday, while the least happen on Sunday.
            <br><br>
            In fact, the average number of crashes per weekday is higher than the average crashes per day of the weekend.
            <br><br> 
            While you might expect the opposite, since most people are spending large amounts of time on weekdays working, the increase in people during commute hours outweighs this.

            Now, looking at the average number of crashes over the course of a year on each weekday, when split by pre and post Covid, there is a few things to notice.
            <br><br>
            First, like the monthly trends the overall shape is similar pre and post Covid.
            <br><br>
            In this case however, there is an interesting difference in the shapes. If we look at when the number of crashes pre and post Covid are the closest, we notice that this happens on the weekends.
            <br><br>
            This increased difference on weekdays compared to weekends pre and post Covid could indicate a still ongoing increase in remote work.
